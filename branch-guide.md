# Branch guide

`main` is the integration branch. Start focused branches from an up-to-date
`main` and submit pull requests back to it.

Use descriptive names such as `feature/run-filtering`, `fix/retry-state`, or
`docs/setup`. Codex-created branches use `codex/<description>`.

Before requesting review, build and test the solution as described in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Explain the problem, resulting behavior,
and validation. Keep unrelated changes in separate pull requests.

Maintainers choose the merge method and configure any required GitHub checks
or reviews. Delete merged topic branches when they are no longer needed.

## Versions and releases

`VERSION` supplies the shared MSBuild version. Use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, optionally
with a prerelease suffix. The current `0.x` series is under active development;
review the changelog for compatibility changes before upgrading.

For a release, update `VERSION`, move the relevant Unreleased notes in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) into a version heading with the actual release date,
and build, test, and inspect the packages. After merging, tag the release commit
as `v<version>`. A tag alone does not publish packages; publication is a separate
maintainer action.
