# Security policy

## Supported versions

The project is in the `0.x` development series. Security fixes target the current
development line; older versions have no promised backport support. No response
time or long-term support commitment is currently defined.

## Report a vulnerability

Do not disclose vulnerabilities, exploit details, credentials, or private data
in public issues or pull requests.

Use the repository's **Security > Report a vulnerability** option if private
vulnerability reporting is enabled. If the option is unavailable, check the
[maintainer's profile](https://github.com/patware) for an available private
contact method. If neither is available, open an issue asking only for a private
security contact, without disclosing the vulnerability.

In the private report, include affected versions, impact, reproduction steps,
and a minimal proof of concept when possible. Remove secrets and personal data.
Coordinate public disclosure with the maintainer while a fix is investigated.

## Deployment considerations

The web project is a demo. Applications deploying pipeline monitoring, retry
controls, or the Hangfire dashboard should provide authentication and
authorization appropriate to their environment. Treat workflow inputs, outputs,
and logs as potentially sensitive and protect database access accordingly.
